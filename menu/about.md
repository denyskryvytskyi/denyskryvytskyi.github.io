Hi there, I'm DenysðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Software Engineer working as an Engine Programmer on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" target="_blank" class="content">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> series at <a href="https://room8group.com/" target="_blank" class="content">Room 8 Group</a>. 

Previously worked at Frag Lab on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2087030/Shatterline/" target="_blank" class="content">Shatterline</a> (multiplayer FPS game) using the Lumberyard game engine.

Also, I'm working on my game engine <a href="https://github.com/kryvytskyidenys/ElvenEngine" target="_blank" class="content">Elven Engine</a> to learn more about game engine architecture, graphics programming and how things actually work under the hood.

I'm experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and try my best to make something useful.
