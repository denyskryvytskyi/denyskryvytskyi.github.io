Hi there, my name is Denis. I'm Software Engineer at Frag Lab and Master’s in Computer Science.

I'm currently working on game engine [Elven Engine](https://github.com/kryvytskyidenys/ElvenEngine) to learn more about complex systems architecture

Also I've started my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx90zcUS9qnt0JInGaot2IQ) about software engineering
